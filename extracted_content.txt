Cultural Note
In Indonesia, a smile goes a long way. People are generally very friendly and polite. When greeting someone, especially someone older, a slight nod of the head is a sign of respect. Don't be surprised if people you've just met ask you personal questions like "Are you married?" or "Where are you going?"—it's a common way to be friendly and make conversation, not to be nosy! In surf areas like Bali, using the local greeting "Om Swastiastu" shows great respect for the local culture.

Chapter 2: Getting to Know You - Pronouns & Simple Questions
Content
Subject Pronouns
Pronouns in Indonesian are simple because they don't change based on their position in a sentence. Here are the most important ones:
Saya
 - I, me, my (can be used in formal and informal situations)
Anda
 - You (formal, polite - use with strangers, elders, or in business)
Kamu
 - You (informal - use with friends, family, people your age or younger)
Dia
 - He, she, him, her (there is no gender in Indonesian pronouns!)
Kita
 - We, us (inclusive - includes the person you're talking to)
Kami
 - We, us (exclusive - does 
not
 include the person you're talking to)
Mereka
 - They, them
The distinction between 
kita
 and 
kami
 is important. If you and a friend are talking to a third person and say, "
Kita
 pergi ke toko" (We are going to the store), it means all three of you are going. If you say, "
Kami
 pergi ke toko," it means only you and your friend are going, not the person you're speaking to.
Forming Simple "Yes/No" Questions
The easiest way to form a yes/no question is to take a statement and say it with a rising intonation at the end.
Statement: 
Anda sehat.
 (You are healthy.)
Question: 
Anda sehat?
 (Are you healthy?)
Another common way is to add the particle 
-kah
 to the word you are questioning, which is often the first word. This is slightly more formal.
Apakah Anda sehat?
 (Are you healthy?) "Apa" is a question word, and adding -kah makes it clear it's a yes/no question.
Asking "What?" and "Where?" Questions
Apa?
 - What?
Apa ini?
 - What is this?
Ini apa?
 - What is this? (more common in speech)
Response: 
Ini buku.
 - This is a book.
Di mana?
 - Where?
Di mana toilet?
 - Where is the toilet?
Response: 
Toilet di sana.
 - The toilet is over there.
Asking for Directions & Surf Info
Di mana pantai [Beach Name]?
 - Where is [Beach Name] beach?
Belok kiri / Belok kanan / Lurus saja
 - Turn left / Turn right / Go straight.
Aman untuk berselancar?
 (ah-mahn oon-took bur-suh-lan-char?) - Is it safe to surf?
Di mana saya bisa sewa papan selancar?
 (dee mah-nah sah-yah bee-sah seh-wah pah-pahn suh-lan-char?) - Where can I rent a surfboard?
Berapa harga untuk satu jam?
 (buh-rah-pah har-gah oon-took sah-too jahm?) - How much for one hour?
Common Nouns for Everyday Objects
Rumah (roo-mah) - House
Mobil (mo-beel) - Car
Buku (boo-koo) - Book
Air (ah-eer) - Water
Makanan (mah-kah-nan) - Food
Kopi (ko-pee) - Coffee
Teh (teh) - Tea
Toilet (toy-let) - Toilet
Toko (to-ko) - Store / Shop
Papan selancar (pah-pahn suh-lan-char) - Surfboard
Sepeda motor (suh-peh-dah mo-tor) - Motorcycle / Scooter
Warung (wah-roong) - Small, local eatery

Cultural Note
Have you ever heard of 
jam karet
, or "rubber time"? It's a well-known concept in Indonesia that reflects a more relaxed and flexible approach to time and punctuality. While it's not an excuse to be late for important business meetings, it's common for social gatherings to start a bit later than scheduled. It’s part of the laid-back culture. So if you're meeting a friend and they're 15-30 minutes late, don't worry—it's likely just a case of jam karet! For surfing, however, be mindful of the tides (
pasang surut
)—nature doesn't operate on rubber time!
Summary

Asking "How much/many?"
The question word

 is incredibly useful, especially when shopping.
Berapa?
 - How much / How many?
Berapa harganya?
 - How much is the price? (Very common)
Days of the Week

Senin
 (suh-nin)

Telling Time
To ask the time:

Jam lima.

Cultural Note
Bargaining, or 
tawar-menawar
, is a common and expected practice in traditional markets (
pasar
), with street vendors, and even for services like renting a scooter or surfboard in Indonesia. It's a friendly and social interaction, not an argument. The first price offered is often inflated. As a foreigner, you might be given a higher price, but a smile and a polite "Bisa kurang?" (
Can it be less?
) can open up a negotiation. Never start with a ridiculously low offer, and always keep the interaction light and friendly. It's a fun way to practice your numbers!
Summary
You've made great progress! In this chapter, you learned to count from 1 to 100, a logical system that's easy to remember. You can now ask "how much" (

), name the days of the week, and ask for and tell the time. These are practical skills you can use every single day.

Chapter 4: The Core of the Sentence - Basic Verbs & Sentence Structure
Content
Basic Sentence Structure (S-P-O)
Indonesian sentence structure is wonderfully straightforward: 
Subject - Predicate - Object
. The predicate is usually a verb. It's very similar to English, but simpler, as verbs don't change for tense or person. "Saya makan" can mean I eat, I am eating, or I ate, depending on context (or by adding time markers like "yesterday" or "tomorrow," which we'll learn later).
Saya
 (Subject) 
makan
 (Predicate/Verb) 
nasi
 (Object).
I eat rice.
Common Verbs
Here are some of the most useful verbs to get you started.
makan
 (mah-kahn) - to eat
minum
 (mee-noom) - to drink
tidur
 (tee-door) - to sleep
pergi
 (per-gee) - to go
mau
 (ma-oo) - to want
suka
 (soo-kah) - to like
baca
 (bah-chah) - to read
beli
 (buh-lee) - to buy
berselancar
 (bur-suh-lan-char) - to surf
menginap
 (muh-ngee-nahp) - to stay overnight
sewa
 (seh-wah) - to rent
Examples:
Dia suka kopi.
 - He/She likes coffee.
Mereka mau pergi.
 - They want to go.
Saya baca buku.
 - I read a book.
Besok saya mau berselancar.
 - Tomorrow I want to go surfing. (
Besok
 = tomorrow)
Negation: 
Tidak
 vs. 
Bukan
Indonesian has two words for "no" or "not," and they have specific uses.
Tidak
 (tee-dak) - Used to negate 
verbs
 and 
adjectives
.
Saya tidak mau.
 - I don't want to. (negating the verb 'mau')
Kopi ini tidak panas.
 - This coffee is not hot. (negating the adjective 'panas')
Bukan
 (boo-kahn) - Used to negate 
nouns
.
Ini bukan kopi.
 - This is not coffee. (negating the noun 'kopi')
Saya bukan turis.
 - I am not a tourist. (negating the noun 'turis')
Think of it this way: 
tidak
 is for actions and descriptions, while 
bukan
 is for things and identities.

Making Plans & Connecting
Here's how to use your verbs to connect with people.
Ayo makan bersama!
 (ah-yo mah-kahn bur-sah-mah) - Let's eat together!
Ayo pergi ke pantai.

Cultural Note
Food is at the heart of Indonesian culture. The word for cooked rice, 
nasi
, is so central that the phrase "sudah makan?" ("have you eaten yet?") is often used as a general greeting, like "how are you?". Sharing food is a key part of socializing. Inviting someone to eat with "Ayo makan!" is a great gesture of friendship. When eating, especially in more traditional settings, it's polite to only use your right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean. Also, it's polite to finish the food on your plate to show you enjoyed the meal!

Cultural Note
The words for mother (
Ibu
) and father (
Bapak
) are also very important terms of respect. You use 
Bapak
 (or the shortened 
Pak
) to respectfully address any man who is older than you or in a position of authority (e.g., a teacher, a boss, a government official). Similarly, you use 
Ibu
 (or 
Bu
) to address any older or respected woman. Using "Pak" or "Bu" before someone's name (e.g., Pak Joko, Bu Siti) is the standard polite way to address them. This politeness extends to the surf lineup; a smile, a nod, and giving way to local surfers are key to a good session.
Summary
Congratulations on completing the final chapter! You can now describe the world around you using common adjectives like 
besar
, 
enak
, and 
panas
, remembering to always place them 
after
 the noun. You also learned the words for key family members and the simple way to show possession by placing a pronoun after an object. With the added travel and surf vocabulary, you now have a fantastic foundation to connect with people and navigate your travels in Indonesia.
